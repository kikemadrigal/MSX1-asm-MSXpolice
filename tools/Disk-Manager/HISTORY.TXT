DiskMgr V0.15:
--------------
- Added command-line arguments /A /C and /F
  to add files in command- or batch-mode.
  See Help-documentation for details.
  (Thanks to NYYRIKKI for this suggestion).
- Fixed filename-conversion, when adding
  files with long names to a disk-image.
  Specific older and all newer windows-computers
  produced empty filenames in this case.
- Fixed possible disk-corruption, that occured
  if an existing non-empty file in the disk-image
  was replaced by an empty file.
  (the start-cluster was not reset).
- Fixed a hang (infinite loop) when attempting
  to delete a file on a corrupted disk.
- Fixed possible memory-corruption in case
  an invalid disk-image is attempted to be
  opened by dragging it onto Disk-Manager.


DiskMgr V0.14:
--------------
- Saved Default DiskFormat was not restored
- Abort/Retry/Ignore on errors when reading or
  writing a floppy disk was probably displayed
  twice (depending on the choosen option)
- Added optional "Fast write" mode
  [Thanks to Paul Deco for supporting me in
  Windows and Disk-Controller specific issues
  with disks that have defect sectors]

DiskMgr V0.13:
--------------
- Fixed incorrect folder-icons in Windows 7
- Drag & Drop within the same DiskManager window
  does no longer prompt for replace-confirmation

DiskMgr V0.12:
--------------
- fix for allowed characters in FAT filenames:
  + the ' character was not allowed prior versions
  + characters >= 128 (like ´) were mistakenly allowed
- added option to specify strength of how
  FAT filenames should be checked.
  This enables handling of files with potentially
  invalid characters in their name(s).
  New default "Regular" is almost compatible with
  the prior implementation and fine for most uses.
- extracting a file (normal or Drag&Drop) could
  have been result in attributes of the extracted file
  being read-only.
- dragging the same file(s) multiple times could
  have been resulted in unpredictable error-messages.
- fixed adding of multiple files using Drag & Drop
  denying a 'replace' aborted attempts to add more files
- enabled add of multiple files in Edit->Add file...
- changed WinHelp to HtmlHelp
  (state-of-the-art, also supported by Windows Vista)
- DiskMgr now saves the width of columns
  (for different countries and resolutions)
- DiskMgr now saves the last used style
  (report, list, icon, small icon)
- fixed occurences of hardcoded english text
- Warning for overriding sensitive data applies to
  Win95/98/ME only (volume tracking driver) and is
  therefore displayed on such systems only!
- fixed Help for "Write to disk"
- Windows 95 is no longer supported, Disk-Manager runs
  on Windows 98 and higher and Windows 2000 and higher
- Vista support (Installer, High DPI awareness, ...)
- Changed hotkeys to fix conflicts with common keys:
  Add is now Alt+A (instead of Ctrl+A)
  Extract is now Alt+E (instead of Ctrl+E)

DiskMgr V0.11:
--------------
- Boot-sector selection for new disk-images is now
  supporting MSX-DOS, MSX-DOS 2 and MS-DOS 6. The
  sectors of MSX-DOS 2 and MS-DOS 6 are always
  initialized with a random volume serial number.
- Archive bit of extracted files was always set,
  even if the file in the image did not have it.

DiskMgr V0.10:
--------------
- Dragging and dropping a file within the same
  DiskMgr instance might have required multiple
  replace-confirmations. This is now fixed!
- Adding files with "Normal" attributes might have
  resulted in files that are not accessible from
  MSX computers and MSX emulations.

DiskMgr V0.09:
--------------
- Completed drag & drop support

DiskMgr V0.08:
--------------
- Disk-Manager could not open read-only archives,
  i.e. disk-images stored on CD-ROM's!
- Disk-Manager now also recognizes commented images
  (created by IBM's SaveDSKF/LoadDSKF). Comments are
  displayed, can not be changed but are saved again.
- Disk-Manager now also displays the file-selection if
  the list is inactive (i.e. while properties are dispayed).
  This handling is conform to the Windows 2000 Explorer!
- Disk-Manager corrupted files of 1.44" diskettes
  if extracing from or moving into the image
  (all formats with clustersize <> 2 sectors were affected).
- Added support for VMware floppy-image (*.flp)

DiskMgr V0.07:
--------------
- Disk-Manager reported unmatching FAT's,
  even if only one FAT exists in image
- "Create Directory..." choice removed from menu,
  because Disk-Manager V1.00 will not support it
- Removal of subdirectories disabled,
  because this does not free all clusters
  (also Disk-Manager V1.00 does not support subdirs)
- In some rare cases added files could contain
  lowercase characters, which cannot be read by
  all DOS-versions.
- Implemented "Custom..." format
  to create harddisk-images
  (without header or partition-table: BETA!!!)
- Pressing SHIFT while selecting "File/Properties..."
  displays now low-level media information
- Windows destroys boot-sector of copy-protected
  MSX-diskettes!
  Warning message added before read is performed.

DiskMgr V0.06:
--------------
- Setup-option '/R' did not work correctly
  if started from Windows NT command-prompt
- DiskManager is now able to fixup
  diskimage-informations, even if sector 0 is
  corrupted or disk is heavily copy-protected
- Documentation about harrdisks/partitions
  and known diskimage-formats added

DiskMgr V0.05:
--------------
- "Write to disk..." function added
- Setup-option '/R' added: execute
  'DISKMGR /R' to register *.DSK extension
- DISKMGR failed to find required files,
  if started from Windows NT commandline
- Added support for 1.44MB (HD) diskettes
- Copy Disk-to-Image crashed,
  if drive was already locked
  (i.e. disk was being formatted)
- Data-changes on floppy disk were not
  automatically applied in the explorer
  (needed to be refreshed manually)
- Win95: data-change on floppy disk might
  cause data-corruption if simultaneous
  changes have been made from other programs
  (Windows NT implementation worked fine)
- Help updated

DiskMgr V0.04:
--------------
- Disk-Image associations enabled
  (DiskMgr.exe accepts image-name arguments)
- Disk-property and file-property dialog changed
- Disk-error maintainance enabled
  (does not auto-save if unchanged disk-image is
  closed. You must save the disk-image explicitly)
- Support for file/firectory renaming added
- Errorhandling impoved (error-codes translated)

DiskMgr V0.03:
--------------
- Directory-full error, even if there
  should be space left
  (i.e. 48 of 112 entries avaliable only)
  Disk-image was incorrectly initialized.
  Create a new image to fix the problem!!
- Add to image: replace existing file
  might fail and created duplicate
  directory-entries with same name
  Create a new image to fix the problem!!
- Extracted file got incorrect (new)
  date and time
- Disk-to-image copy capabilities added
- Icon-views added
- Volume-Label dialog moved to 'File'-menu

DiskMgr V0.02:
--------------
- 1st official beta-release
